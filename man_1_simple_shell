.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a basic Unix shell program implemented in C. It provides an interactive command-line interface where users can execute system commands, use built-in commands, and work with environment variables.

.SH COMMAND EXCUTION

Once a user inputs a command and hits enter, the shell performs the following actions:

1. Displaying the prompt.

2. Reading the command.

3. Command interpretation.
When locating a command, the shell looks for a built-in command by that name.
If a built-in command is not found, the shell searches for the command in the PATH.

4. Command execution (executed in a child process of the main process).

5. Waiting for the command to finish.

.SH BUILT-IN
