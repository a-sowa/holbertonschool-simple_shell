# Holberton School - C Project - Simple Shell

## Project's description

This project is a custom implementation of a UNIX Simple Shell, it was made during the software development program of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/).

## hsh Simple Shell's decription

This program is the recreation of the UNIX shell, a command line interpreter, that allows a user to interact with a computer by running commands or programs. The shell parses the commands and sends them to the operating system to perform.

### The shell should do the following:

* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
* The command lines should handle arguments
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Handle the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (Ctrl+D)
* Handle the PATH
* Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
* Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
* Handles interactive and non-interactive mode

## Installation and compilation
To start using this program, first, clone the repository 
`https://github.com/a-sowa/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git`

and compile in the following way
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

## How to use the program
In your terminal, type `./hsh` to run the program. You will see the prompt `($)` which indicates that it is ready to receive the command. 
Currently, this simple shell handles the  *built-in* commands, for instance,

`exit` - exits the shell<br />
`env` - prints the current environment variables<br />
ctrl+d - This represent EOF(end of files), and it will exit the prompt and return you to the original shell.

They are run right away. However, if the commands are not built-ins, they are searched for in the `PATH` directory and then are executed. If the command is not found or the user does not have the permission to run it, an error message will be printed.

**Example 2**

Interactive mode will display the same output as the interactive one

```
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
